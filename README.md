ðŸ“Š **Tech - a - Intern Data Analytics Internship: HR Employee Attrition Analysis** ðŸ“Š

Welcome to my Data Analytics internship journey with Tech - a - Intern! In this repository, I've explored the HR Employee Attrition dataset to uncover valuable insights. I used Python's Jupyter Notebook along with libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn to analyze the data.

**Key Observations:**
- Explored a dataset with 1470 rows and 35 columns.
- No missing values detected, ensuring data quality.
- Mapped categorical variables to numerical values for analysis.
- Utilized visualizations to highlight patterns and trends.
- Identified factors impacting attrition, including department, daily rate, promotions, and more.
  
Feel free to explore my code and findings, and let's connect to discuss this exciting journey further!
